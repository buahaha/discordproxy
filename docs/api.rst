API
===

The API is defined with Google's `Protocol Buffers <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/>`_ (aka protobuf). It consists of the service :ref:`protobufs:DiscordApi` and it's methods.

Please see :ref:`protobufs:Protocol Documentation` for a complete documentation of the service with it's methods and messages.

Or if you want to generate your own gPRC client you can find the protobuf definition files in the ``/protobufs`` folder.

In addition the Python pacakge contains an overview of the gRPC classes and helpers useful for gRPC clients.
